<p>This is an example of a parameterised HTML report produced with <code>rmarkdown</code>. Given a dataset, an <code>rmarkdown</code> script, a list of parameters to pass to it (in this case Continents) and a rendering function, we can batch produce a report for each Continent supplied to the report script.</p>
<p>The data, script, render function and generated reports are viewable in this <a href="https://github.com/PaulC91/gapminder_reports">github repository</a>.</p>
<p>For information about automated data reporting wit R, check out this <a href="https://www.cultureofinsight.com/blog/2018/10/22/2018-08-20-automated-data-reports-with-r/">blogpost on the Culture of Insight website</a>.</p>

<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>Making the switch to doing your data work with R can be daunting, but with the combination of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/" target="_blank">RStudio</a> as your ‘integrated development environment’, the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">tidyverse packages</a> for data analysis, and <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank">rmarkdown</a> for producing reports in just about any format you’d like (HTML, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Dashboard, even entire websites like this one!), there has never been a better time to make the leap and start your journey to better data reporting workflows. There’s also a really great and welcoming community of R users online who are always happy to help new users feel at home.</p>
<p>If you’d like some help getting started, we’re currently running a 1-day ‘Master Data with Code’ workshop where you’ll learn how to import, manipulate, join and transform data using the <code>tidyverse</code> in the RStudio IDE.</p>
<p>We also offer bespoke in-house training for teams where we focus on your own specific data tasks and how you can use R for greater accuracy and efficiency in data processing, and engagement in your communicated insights.</p>
<p>For more information get in touch via our <a href="https://cultureofinsight.com/contact/">Contact Page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
